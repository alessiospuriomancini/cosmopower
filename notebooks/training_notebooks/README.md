- [cosmopower_NN_CMB_training.ipynb](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower/blob/main/notebooks/training_notebooks/cosmopower_NN_CMB_training.ipynb) shows how to train a ``cosmopower_NN`` model. The example in this notebooks is emulation of CMB TT power spectra, however the procedure is analogous for every other type of spectrum, including matter power spectrum.

- [cosmopower_PCAplusNN_CMB_training.ipynb](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower/blob/main/notebooks/training_notebooks/cosmopower_PCAplusNN_CMB_training.ipynb) shows how to train a ``cosmopower_PCAplusNN`` model. The example in this notebooks is emulation of CMB <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\phi \phi"> power spectra, however the procedure is again analogous for every other type of spectrum.

- cosmopower_NN_3times2pt.ipynb shows how to train a ``cosmopower_NN`` model. The example in this notebook shows an emulation of the 3x2pt statistic from the DES Y3 models.
