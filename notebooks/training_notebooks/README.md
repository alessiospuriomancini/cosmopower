- [cosmopower_NN_CMB_training.ipynb](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower/blob/main/notebooks/training_notebooks/cosmopower_NN_CMB_training.ipynb) shows how to train a ``cosmopower_NN`` model. The example in this notebooks is emulation of CMB TT power spectra, however the procedure is analogous for every other type of spectrum, including matter power spectrum.
